Heath gave intro to ZF2 to swing us into the exercises

Decided to start with the homepage twitter feed
*	Looked for zf2 twitter module to use
*	Since there were no modules, we are going to create one and submit to zend
	*	Module will be built around an already existing twitter composer package

Broke into issues: https://github.com/hrphpmeetup/portal/issues
Paired up on issues and started work.
