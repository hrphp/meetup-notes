==============

* Watched "Is TDD dead" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGtasFJnUxI
* Follow up discussion about video
* Discussion lead into looking at a class to see how we would test
* That lead into refactor comments and ideas.

Action Items:
* We decided that we will come back to this class in another meet up and try a rewrite that we would potentially compare with a later version.
