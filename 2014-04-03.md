We started out the meetup with Guillermo's presentation on implementing predefined interfaces and classes

For his presentation, he pulled open PHP documentation for each interface or class, explained the definition, then described examples and real world applications.

He went over all classes in each section:

Traversable
http://www.php.net/manual/en/reserved.interfaces.php

Exception
http://www.php.net/manual/en/reserved.exceptions.php

SPL
http://www.php.net/manual/en/spl.interfaces.php


After the presentation, we decided that next meetup, we will use sections of code that can be used for our group site to generate exercises.

Then we had a discussion about up-coming presentations.  
	-As  group we decided that we will be moving away from "beginner" level presentations, and doing whatever topics the group is interested in, with a potential 10 minute presentation on a more begginer subject, usually that subject being a pre-req to the later presentation.
		-That sparked discussion on next the presentation.  First decided on ZF2, then went over other potential subjects which lead to a discussion on PHP namespacing, which then lead to a decision on namespacing as the next presentation subject.
